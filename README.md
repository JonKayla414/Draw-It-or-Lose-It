Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room client would like to expand their gaming application to multiple platforms. This application is web based. There must be a server-style configuration for hosting the website and it must have scalability. There will be different client side applications to account for the players on iOS and Android mobile platforms. The application should have uniformity and look similar across all platforms. There must be a modern responsive HTML interface running for the desktop clients (Linux, Windows, and Mac).  Each application will be able to communicate with the web server. 




What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

This document goes into details of the system arcitecure and development recomandations. It goes into details of planning out the networking side, ensuring security, and devolping different codes for the different platforms that will be used.



What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through a design document ensures that developers take the appropriate steps to make sure the project is a success. If we go by the RESTful API and seperate client side and server side, then we have to use different programming languages to make sure they are compatible. The client can expand the software to other platforms. The design document describes the different OS and application requirements. This is useful to refrence what needs to be done.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would revise the System Architecture. I think thoroughly describing the requirements will make it easier in developing this project. Deploying an application and expanding it to mulitple platforms require proper planning and details need to be clear and concise. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's need by describing the possible platforms a user could use. Each OS require different programming languages. We need to ensure that the appropriate one is used for the client-side application. Security and confentiality was also considered. Following the security practices ensure that the User's data is secure and the appropriate user is accesing that specific data. 


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Designing software requires proper planning if the systems architecture. The tenchniques is first describing the goal of the project and determining which is best for the systems architecture. I would use this in the future to design a project beacuse it ensures that developers are taking the appropriate steps. This will make the development of a process easier and ensure the project is a success.
